Dots: Demonstration of a possible SVG rendering bug in Google Closure and/or Chrome

On Safari, FF, and IE, you should see a red dot appear wherever you click in the gray background area.

On Chrome 7.0.517.41, you may see a few dots appear, but then they either won't appear at all or only partially. After more clicking, all unrendered dots will appear at once.

To install the Google Closure dependency:

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

(see also: http://daniel.collectiveidea.com/blog/2008/4/9/git-submodules)

To create dependencies:

$ ./deps

Demos are located in demo directory.
